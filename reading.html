    <p>I've been reading since the age of ten, when I discovered the Twilight Saga movies and became so obsessed
        with it that I just <em>had to</em> read the books. It might not seem like a very refined place to start, 
        but it opened the door for me to read much more well written books. Some of my favorite books are <em>A Little
        Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara, <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> by Khaled Housseini, and <em>The Legendborn Cycle</em>
        series by Tracy Deonn
        <br>
        For 2023, I have a reading goal of 15 books. So far I've read:
        <ol>
            <li>Carrie Soto is Back</li>
            <li>Ninth House</li>
            <li>The Hunger Games Trilogy which is comprised of
                <ol>
                <li>The Hunger Games</li>
                <li>Catching Fire</li>
                <li>Mockingjay</li>
                </ol>
            </li> 

        </ol>
        I'm not reading anything at the moment.
